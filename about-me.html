    I am a Software Developer who is in love with what she does, and smiles everytime she sees a cleverly written code.

    I have moved to Sweden to study at KTH, Master's in Interactive Media Technology and picked all the courses I can that is related to game development. Because, why not combine two things that I love, programming and video games (I also love my two cats but it is not easy to combine that with programming :) ). I have worked in lots of interesting projects at KTH, which you can see the details on my <a href="/">projects page</a>.

    In my free time, I like playing video games and I especially like strategy, management and simulation games. However, the games that have touched me the most are story-driven games (PS. I am really afraid something bad is going to happen to Joel in Last of Us 2). I also play the piano (not so well), and paint (not so well either). I enjoy watching movies and always up to discussing about them!

    Now, I need to go rewatch the extended edition of Lord of the Rings for the millionth time, but if you have questions or would like to reach out to me just say Hi! at <a href="mailto:nilaykaraoglu@outlook.se">nilaykaraoglu@outlook.com</a>
