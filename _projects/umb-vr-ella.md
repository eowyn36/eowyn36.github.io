Umb-vr-ella is a virtual reality game where an umbrella is your only help during free fall. You need to collect coins, use boosters and avoid bombs to survive.

The game is implemented in Unreal Engine and played on a Oculus Rift headset. The player uses a physical umbrella and the movement of the physical umbrella is mapped to ingame movement of the character via a phone that is attached to the umbrella.

We have showcased the game at [ForskarFredag](https://forskarfredag.se/stockholm/) to high school students.
We have also showcased at [Mission IX](http://beta.missionix.com/).
