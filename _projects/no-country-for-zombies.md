No Country For Zombies is a multiplayer game based on Unity and C#, played on Microsoft PixelSense and Android phones.

Players who are using their phones to play, are spawned into the labyrinth and have a first-person perspective. Their goal is to cooperate and overcome the zombies and other monsters with appropriate weapons.

Another player who is in control of the PixelSense is responsible for creating the zombies and monsters. Pixelsense shows the map of the laybrinth in a top down view. The player can spawn monsters by using few different 3D printeD figures. These figures have fiducial markers under them, which PixelSense can recognise. According to the recognised fiducial marker, monsters are spawned in-game.

You can see photos of people playing and additional information at [our webpage](https://umb-vr-ela.github.io/web/zombies/)
