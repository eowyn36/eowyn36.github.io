No Country For Zombies is a multi-player game based on Unity and C#, played on Microsoft Pixelse and Android phones. 

The players on the phones are spawned in to labyrint and have a first-person perspective. Their goal is to co-operate, overcome the zombies and other monsters with appropriate weapons.

Another player that is in control of the pixelsense is responsoble for creating the zombies and monsters. Pixelsense shows the map of the laybrint in a top down view. And player can spawn monsters by using few different 3d printed figures. These figures have fiducial markers another them that the pixelsense can read. According to the recognised fiducial marker monsters are spawned ingame.
