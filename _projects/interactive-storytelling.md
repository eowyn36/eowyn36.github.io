The project explores possibilities of storytelling and speech interaction by making a simple digital illustrated story book for children that animates when being read out loud. As a proof of concept, we've built an application that contains 4 frames which depict an event in the story. User can control the progress and narrative of this graphical novel using a cloud hosted speech API that recognise user speech input.
