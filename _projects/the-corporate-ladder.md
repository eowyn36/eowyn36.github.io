The Corporate Ladder is a third person click & point sandbox puzzle game. Developed as Computer Game Design course project at KTH.

The game is set in an office and the player is allowed to freely manipulate the environment in minor ways, such as relocating and activating office paraphernalia and other employees (NPCs).

Puzzles are hinted through in-game cues but are not compulsory. However, the puzzles, which consists of a given series of actions that must be performed, will reward the player in the form of promotions and by creating an amusing effect on the local game world.
