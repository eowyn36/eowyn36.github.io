CAT is a web-based visualization tool that shows the data of prostate cancer patients in Sweden. This project was made in collaboration with KI (Karolinska Institutet) and Janssen J&J to help them better understand their demographic by giving them the tools to create cohorts and find their own correlations and relationships.

Check out the tool on [Cohort Analysis Tool](https://raghunayyar.github.io/IVI17).
