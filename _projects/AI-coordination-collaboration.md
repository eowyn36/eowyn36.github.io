---

Finding optimal positions to place the guards, path planing to cover point of interests and formation keeping are multi-agent problems with real-life applications. In this project three methods, sometimes used in combination, are used to give solutions to these problems. These methods use set cover algorithm, greedy algorithm, k-cluster and Kinodynamic RTT* implemented in Unreal Engine with C++.

| My Role | Reading the problem files provided as json, creating helper classes, setting the initial values, creating the 3d map with guards and POIs placed. Collision check for POIs and guards. Implementation of formation keeping for number of guards moving together.  Implementations are done mostly in C++ and some in blueprints. |
