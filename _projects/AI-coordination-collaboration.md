Finding optimal positions to place the guards, path planing to cover point of interests and formation keeping are multi-agent problems with real-life applications. In this project three methods, sometimes used in combination, are used to give solutions to these problems. These methods use set cover algorithm, greedy algorithm, k-cluster and Kinodynamic RTT* implemented in Unreal Engine with C++.
