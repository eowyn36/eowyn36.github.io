After learning that one of my teammates have experience in Autodesk Maya and since it is free for students, I decided to switch to Maya. If I ran into any problems, it will be easier to overcome them. Even though it might have been better to make this decision before, I do not see the time I spent on Blender to be waste of time since I enjoy learning new things.

So I re-modeled everything in Maya.
