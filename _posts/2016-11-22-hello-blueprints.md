Apart from making the models, I wanted to gain experience in Unreal Engine.

In the story, Stan Dart can read other people’s mine, so I decided to implement this. I created a new Blueprint that we will use for all of the Coworkers. It took few tries to figure out what should be the Parent Class, and I ended up extending the Character Class. I programmed it so that when Stan Dart is close to his coworkers a text appear on their head. But as you can see from the image below, the first version did not look so good.

Later on, I created a widget for thought boxes and this made it so much easier to make the visual  changes I want. I have added the widget to the Coworker blueprint as component and now it looks much better.

Before using Blueprints, I liked the idea of actually writing code much more than visual programming. However, I enjoyed visual programming while working with Unreal Engine. Even though it sometimes gets frustrating to find a way to do something that you could have done with 2 lines of code, I can say that it was fun.
