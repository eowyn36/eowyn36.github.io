I have decided to create the needed models for our game because I want to learn about it.  On our meetings our team liked the idea of having a low-poly aesthetic. With low level of detail, I managed to create basic office furniture models.

My first decision was to make the models in Blender since it is free. After watching introduction videos and tutorials, I managed make my first model: a desk. Basically, a flat surface with four pointy sticks attached to it, really easy and basic model for a beginner ðŸ™‚

At the end of my first day of modelling, I created; a desk, a chair, a small bin, a computer with screen, keyboard and mouse.

I really liked making models, though working with small edges and vertices can be challenging. The decision to make the models with low level detail definitely helped me time-wise.

Biggest challenge I had with Blender was selecting an object. I had to google how to select, because left-clicking is used to position the 3d-cursor. My brief introduction to Blender did not teach me about what 3d-cursor is used for but having to right-click when selecting is like going against the nature.
