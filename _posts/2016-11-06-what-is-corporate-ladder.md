title: Dev Blog \#1 – What is Corporate Ladder ?
category: the-corporate-ladder
---

Corporate Ladder is the name of the game that we are making as a 6-people team for our Computer Game Design course in KTH.

The idea started with making a dungeon-crawler game but instead of going down a level, like you would in a dungeon-crawler, you go up when you complete the level. As the idea progressed the gameplay began to settle. In the end, we decided that the game would take place in a office environment. Each floor in our skyscraper would correspond to a level and after completing the objective for that level, you can go up one level, as in going up on a corporate ladder.

The objectives will be build around ‘fake-it-till-you-make-it’ idea. So the main character will go about stealing his coworkers’ work or feeding them peanut even thought they are allergic to it. We plan on giving a broad objective at the start of the level. There will be various paths to achieve that objective and it will be up to the player to choose which one.

The game will be built in Unreal Engine 4 and will make use of the engine’s capabilities. The of models for the game will be produced by us.
