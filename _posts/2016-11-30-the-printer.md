This week I have added a new model; a printer, a must have in a office. I did not want it to look like a huge rectangle so I decided to add more detail compared to the models I did before. It ended up being the most complicated model I have done. Also, it broke when I imported it to Unreal Engine, if you count having a huge triangle shaped hole in the back of the printer to be problem. I removed few unused vertexes from the model and that fixed the problem.

The scenario we wrote required few interactable objects. Objects that are stationary, that you can not cary but they have some sort of interaction. So, I created a new Blueprint and added some generic variables and function. And I have functions that are specific the an object in their own Blueprints. The printer is probably the star of our story (sorry Stan Dart) and its blueprint ended up being huge and scary.
